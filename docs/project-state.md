## Blockers

| ID | Description | Since | Owner | Action |
|----|-------------|-------|-------|--------|
| BLK-01 | CLEARED 2026-11-01: draft PR #1 created with the new token; verified at G2 attempt 2; RISK-005 closed. History: GitHub MCP create_pull_request returned 403, later HTTP 401 | 2026-10-31 | Santhosh | None |
| BLK-02 | CLOSED 2026-11-01 at G2 attempt 2: the delivery lead decided the repository stays public (AQP-1 10465; DL-008). That the content is not real is their statement, not verified; RISK-006 stays open, restated | 2026-11-01 | Santhosh | None |
| HOLD-02 | RELEASED 2026-11-01: G2 attempt 2 returned CONDITIONAL GO. ux-expert and solution-architect may start now, in parallel | 2026-11-01 | Santhosh; orchestrator | Start both, with conditions 5 and 6 of the gate record |
| HOLD-01 | TR-009 stop: after G3 approval and before development, stop and ask Santhosh for master data defaults (AQP-10). Not in CLAUDE.md, so kept here. State then that the repository is public and ask where the defaults may be held (DL-008) | 2026-11-01 | orchestrator | Stop the run at that point. |
