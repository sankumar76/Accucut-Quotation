**Risks registered:** none
**Rationale:** The three G0 criteria in `CLAUDE.md` §3 are met with evidence in the repository and in Jira. The missing budget and deadline do not block G0: they are not G0 criteria, and they do not change whether there is enough to start discovery. The intake states the gap openly rather than hiding it, so it is recorded here as a carry-forward and not a condition. The numbers are the sponsor's to give, and a project deadline must be known by G2, where the release plan depends on it.

**Carry-forward to G1 (business-analyst; not conditions on this decision)**
- Log project budget and target date as an open question, owner Santhosh, needed by G2.
- Confirm whether "Santhosh / MD" is one person or two; it decides who the business sign-off is.
- Spec §15 item 3 says the sample worksheet is not yet provided and expects `docs/reference/sample-estimate.xlsx`, which does not exist, yet `AMADA-20261006.xlsx` is listed as an input. Confirm whether that file is the sample, then update §15.
